# **Epistemic Pull Request: The Code Thunderdome**  
### *"Your code doesn't get better until it survives the gauntlet."*  

üöÄ **Stop shipping bugs. Start shipping battle-tested code.**  

```bash
pip install Epistemic-Pull-Request
```

## **Your Code is Too Comfortable**  
Right now, your code lives in a **safe space**:  
- Linters catch typos, not logic bombs  
- Tests verify what you *expect*, not what you *missed*  
- CI pipelines just check if it *runs*‚Äînot if it *should exist*  

**YAJPH changes that.**  

## **How It Works**  
1. **Define your rules** (YAML)  
2. **Let AI agents rip your code apart**  
3. **Only merge what survives**  

```yaml
# adversarial_review.yaml
agents:
  murphy:  
    prompt: "Find 5 ways this commit could start a dumpster fire"  
  bayes:  
    prompt: "Calculate the probability this works as intended (with citations)"  
  machiavelli:  
    prompt: "Would merging this create future headaches? Be ruthless."  
```

## **Why Developers Love/Hate This**  
‚úÖ **No more "works on my machine"** ‚Üí Every PR survives a **philosophical tribunal**  
‚úÖ **No more silent failures** ‚Üí Rejections include **exact fixes**  
‚úÖ **No more guessing** ‚Üí Full **Git audit trails** of every debate  

**This isn't CI/CD. This is *Code Darwinism*.**  

## **Get Started in 30 Seconds**  
1. Install:  
   ```bash
   pip install Epistemic-Pull-Request
   ```
2. Add `.github/workflows/bully.yml`:  
   ```yaml
   name: Code Thunderdome  
   on: [pull_request]  
   jobs:  
     review:  
       runs-on: ubuntu-latest  
       steps:  
         - uses: actions/checkout@v4  
         - run: Epistemic-Pull-Request review --rules adversarial_rules.yaml
   ```
3. **Watch your code either improve‚Äîor get mercilessly rejected.**  

## **Choose Your Fighters**  
Pre-loaded AI critics (add your own):  

| Agent        | Role                          | Vibe          |
|--------------|-------------------------------|---------------|
| **Murphy**   | "What could go wrong?"        | Paranoid      |
| **Bayes**    | "Prove it mathematically"     | Pedantic      |
| **Machiavelli** | "Is this *strategically* sound?" | Cutthroat     |
| **Clown**    | "Roast this in meme format"   | Chaotic       |

## **This Isn't For Everyone**  
‚ùå If you like **"LGTM" culture**  
‚ùå If you think **unit tests are enough**  
‚ùå If you **fear machines judging you**  

**But if you want code that *actually* works?**  

```bash
pip install yajph
```  
**Let the games begin.** üèüÔ∏è
